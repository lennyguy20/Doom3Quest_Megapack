D3Q Mods Megapack (Defunkt Build Repack)
To install, copy over all the folders to your Doom3Quest folder. This will make all of the mods show up in your expansions menu below Classic Doom. (no new menu screen this time) Make sure that xpak399.pk4 is in your base folder, otherwise some mod's custom weapon models will show up in your hands instead.

Let me know if you encounter any mod-specific issues only on the Defunkt build.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Mods will always start a new game with the base D3 intro video. Just skip it if you don't want to watch it.
Event Horizon's cutscenes are vomit inducing if not on flat due to forced FOV. Set cutscenes to flat while playing the mod.
